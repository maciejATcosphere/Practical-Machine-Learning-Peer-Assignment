Weight Lifting Sensor Data Analysis
===================================

This analysis attempts to propose the construction of the predictor for weight lifting sensory data. We propose random forest based model because of high accuracy returned by it and fairly decent execution time.

FIXME: It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online
